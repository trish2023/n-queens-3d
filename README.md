# n-queens-3d
This project is a visual and interactive implementation of the N-Queens problem using Three.js in a 3D environment. It helps users understand how N queens can be placed on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other — a classic combinatorial puzzle.

🚀 Features
🧠 Backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem

🏰 Real-time 3D rendering of the board and queen positions using Three.js

📏 Adjustable board size (supports N from 4 to 12)

🎮 Intuitive controls to rotate, zoom, and explore the solution space
